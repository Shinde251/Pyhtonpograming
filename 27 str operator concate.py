# String Operators :-


# + :--> Concatination

s1="chetan"

s2="patil"

s3=s1+s2

print(s3)
print(s1+s2)
print("python"+" Programming")



a="10"

b="20"

print(a+b) #1020

x=int(a)
y=int(b)


print(x+y)  # 30



# when there is + operator between two string then both strings are concatinated
# a="10" b="20"  print(a+b)--> gives resuls as 1020
# when there is + operator between two int then addiition operation is performed
# x=10 and y=20  print(x+y)---> gives result as 30

# if there is + operator between one int and one string then error occured.
# we can solve such problem by using Typecasting.
