# Assignement Operators :-
'''
Assignment Operators are used to assign a value, a variable or
an expression to another variable.

x=10  ---->Assigning value to variable

y=x   ---->Assinging varaible to another variable

z=x+y+30 ->Assigning an expression to anther variable


Various Types of Assignment Operators

+=         x=x+y          x+=y

-=         x=x-y          x-=y

*=         x=x*y          x*=y

/=         x=x/y          x/=y

%=         x=x%y          x%=y

//=        x=x//y         x//=y


**=        x=x**y         x**=y


Assignmnet operators are also called as short-hand operators

Assignment operators are also known as Arithmetic Assignment Operators.
